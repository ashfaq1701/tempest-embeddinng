"""Centroid-to-centroid head on the Poincaré ball: s(u,v) = geo_temp * (-d_H(P_u, P_v)) [+ pop_bias[v]].

The distance term is scaled by a learned geo_temp (init 1.0). When the popularity channel is on, a
learned per-node scalar pop_bias[v] (zero-init, so it contributes exactly 0 at step 0) is added at
FIXED unit weight -- the model sharpens the geometry via geo_temp while popularity rides alongside at
a constant scale.

P_x is the weighted gyro-midpoint of x's walk-token bag; the pooling weights are a softmax over an
MLP of [log1p(age) | raw position | rad] at a fixed hidden width. Nothing is standardised: log1p
is a fixed function of the age alone, so no batch-dependent or dataset-derived quantity enters
the pooler. Learned head params: geo_temp, the MLP pooler, and num_nodes popularity scalars
when on."""

        candidate with a fresh history and one with a decade-old history become indistinguishable
        once their bags are normalised.

        It also does the work no affine rescale can. Ages span orders of magnitude and are
        heavily right-skewed (measured on real YouTube tokens: skew +1.83, and the mean is 2-3x
        the median on every dataset in the suite); log1p takes skew to -1.07. And it compresses
        the cross-dataset scale spread from 47x on raw age/mnia to 1.5x on context log-age
        spread, which is what makes one feature definition serve all eight datasets.
